# CinnamonBot

This is a bot that can play youtube videos in a voice channel in Discord. It will use the link to play the song in the channel so everyone can hear.

The code is very simple and easy to understand.
This requires ytdl-core and discordjs but I have left these folders inside node_modules so downloading it isn't needed.
